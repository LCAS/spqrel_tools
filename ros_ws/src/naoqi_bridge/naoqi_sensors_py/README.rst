Overview
========

NaoCamera_ is a ROS_ driver for cameras accessed through Aldebaran's
NAOqi middleware (typically, on the Nao robot).

This package has no released code API.

**Warning**::

  The master branch normally contains code being tested for the next
  ROS release.  It will not always work with all previous releases.
  Sometimes, it may not work at all.

The current master works with Hydro and Groovy.
